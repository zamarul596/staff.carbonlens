# Fixed Firestore Security Rules

## Problem Analysis
The current rules have these issues:
1. Company ID validation requires authentication, but validation happens before login
2. User document path structure doesn't match the app's data structure
3. Rules are too restrictive for legitimate operations

## Solution
Update the rules to allow proper company validation and user data access.

## Fixed Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow reading companies collection without authentication (for company ID validation)
    match /companies/{companyId} {
      allow read: if true;  // Anyone can read company IDs to validate them
      allow write: if false; // Only allow writes through admin/website
    }
    
    // User data - requires authentication
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Company-specific user data (alternative structure)
    match /companies/{companyId}/users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Default rule - deny everything else
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternative Simplified Rules (Recommended)

If you want a simpler approach that works immediately:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow all operations for authenticated users
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow reading companies without authentication (for validation)
    match /companies/{companyId} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Steps to Fix

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Replace the current rules with one of the above options
3. Click "Publish"
4. Test your app again

## Recommended Approach

Use the **Alternative Simplified Rules** first to get your app working, then gradually add more security as needed.
